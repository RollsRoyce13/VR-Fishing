<h1 align="center">🎣 Unity VR Fishing Project 🎮</h1>

###

<h2 align="left">Overview</h2>

###

<p align="left">This Unity VR project is an immersive fishing simulation that utilizes various VR components and mechanics to provide a realistic experience. The project includes haptic feedback, fish behaviors, and environmental animations. 🌊🐟</p>

###

<h2 align="left">Features</h2>

###

<p align="left">🕹️ XR Device Simulator: Enables control simulation for testing VR interactions. (Refer to the attached PDF for detailed instructions.)<br><br>🎛️ Haptic Feedback: Enhances user experience by simulating tactile sensations during interactions.<br><br>📍 Movement Zone: A small plane defines the playable area for movement.<br><br>⛵ Animated Boat: A dynamic boat animation simulates natural water movement.<br><br>🐠 Fish Prefabs: Three different fish prefabs with settings managed via ScriptableObjects.<br><br>💦 Particle Effects: Effects appear when the bait touches the water and when a fish is pulled out.<br><br>🎣 Fishing Line Simulation: A LineRenderer is used on the fishing rod to simulate realistic fishing line behavior.<br><br>🔊 Ambience & Sound Effects: Added environmental sounds to enhance immersion.<br><br>🎛️ HapticController Object: Manages haptic feedback with customizable settings using ScriptableObjects.<br><br>⚡ Event-Driven System: The project is structured using an event-based architecture for modularity and ease of interaction.<br><br>🧭 Locomotion System: Includes Snap Turn Provider and Teleportation Provider for user movement and rotation in VR.<br><br>🍏 Interaction Layer: You can only hang an apple on the hook (other objects are not allowed). 🍎</p>

###

<h2 align="left">Setup & Usage</h2>

###

<p align="left">1. 🛠️ Open the project in Unity 2021.3.11f1.<br><br>2. 🎧 Ensure you have the necessary VR hardware and Unity XR settings configured.<br><br>3. 📄 Refer to the [XR Device Simulator Guide](https://unity-connect-prd.storage.googleapis.com/20210604/28db6ca9-aba1-4ac3-a15a-24664daff3ea/Rig%20Simulator%20Keyboard%20Shortcuts.pdf) for details on using the XR Device Simulator.<br><br>4. 🎮 Run the scene and interact with the environment using controllers.</p>

###

<h2 align="left">Dependencies</h2>

###

<p align="left">🏗️ Unity XR Toolkit<br><br>🔧 XR Interaction Toolkit<br><br>📜 ScriptableObjects for fish and haptic settings</p>

###

<h2 align="left">Notes</h2>

###

<p align="left">🏗️ The project is designed for ease of customization using ScriptableObjects and event-driven interactions.<br><br>🤖 All major interactions include haptic feedback for enhanced realism.<br><br>🚧 The biggest problem I encountered while working on the project was the lack of a device for testing.</p>

###

<h2 align="left">Future Improvements</h2>

###

<p align="left">🐟 Additional fish species and behaviors.<br><br>🌊 More complex water physics.<br><br>🎯 Expanded fishing mechanics and challenges.<br><br>🏪 Rod/bait purchase shop.<br><br>🗺️ Change fishing locations.</p>
