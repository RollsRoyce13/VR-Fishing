# 🎣 Unity VR Fishing Project 🎮

## Overview

This Unity VR project is an immersive fishing simulation that utilizes various VR components and mechanics to provide a realistic experience. The project includes haptic feedback, fish behaviors, and environmental animations. 🌊🐟

## Features

- **🕹️ XR Device Simulator**: Enables control simulation for testing VR interactions. (Refer to the attached PDF for detailed instructions.)
- **🎛️ Haptic Feedback**: Enhances user experience by simulating tactile sensations during interactions.
- **📍 Movement Zone**: A small plane defines the playable area for movement.
- **⛵ Animated Boat**: A dynamic boat animation simulates natural water movement.
- **🐠 Fish Prefabs**: Three different fish prefabs with settings managed via ScriptableObjects.
- **💦 Particle Effects**: Effects appear when the bait touches the water and when a fish is pulled out.
- **🎣 Fishing Line Simulation**: A LineRenderer is used on the fishing rod to simulate realistic fishing line behavior.
- **🔊 Ambience & Sound Effects**: Added environmental sounds to enhance immersion.
- **🎛️ HapticController Object**: Manages haptic feedback with customizable settings using ScriptableObjects.
- **⚡ Event-Driven System**: The project is structured using an event-based architecture for modularity and ease of interaction.
- **🧭 Locomotion System**: Includes Snap Turn Provider and Teleportation Provider for user movement and rotation in VR.
- **🍏 Interaction Layer**: You can only hang an apple on the hook (other objects are not allowed). 🍎

## Setup & Usage

1. 🛠️ Open the project in Unity (2021.3.11f1).
2. 🎧 Ensure you have the necessary VR hardware and Unity XR settings configured.
3. 📄 Refer to the [XR Device Simulator Guide](https://unity-connect-prd.storage.googleapis.com/20210604/28db6ca9-aba1-4ac3-a15a-24664daff3ea/Rig%20Simulator%20Keyboard%20Shortcuts.pdf) for details on using the XR Device Simulator.
4. 🎮 Run the scene and interact with the environment using controllers.

## Dependencies

- 🏗️ Unity XR Toolkit
- 🔧 XR Interaction Toolkit
- 📜 ScriptableObjects for fish and haptic settings

## Notes

- 🏗️ The project is designed for ease of customization using ScriptableObjects and event-driven interactions.
- 🤖 All major interactions include haptic feedback for enhanced realism.
- 🚧 The biggest problem I encountered while working on the project was the lack of a device for testing.

## Future Improvements

- 🐟 Additional fish species and behaviors.
- 🌊 More complex water physics.
- 🎯 Expanded fishing mechanics and challenges.
- 🏪 Rod/bait purchase shop.
- 🗺️ Change fishing locations.
